# HAWKI - Model Repository

[![License: Apache-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

Welcome to the HAWKI Model Repository! This project provides a comprehensive, up-to-date database of AI models in a single, static `models.json` file.

This repository itself doesn't contain any backend code or dynamic functionality. Instead, it serves as the public host for the curated `models.json` file. This file is automatically generated and updated twice a day by a data-processing pipeline, ensuring you always have access to the latest model information.

Whether you're building the next great AI application or just exploring the landscape, you'll find everything you need to make informed decisions—from pricing and providers to capabilities and technical specifications.

> **BETA NOTICE:** This API is currently in beta. While we strive for accuracy and reliability, please be aware that the structure and content of the API may change as we continue to improve and expand the list.

## 🚀 Getting Started: Using the Model Data

Accessing the model data is as simple as fetching a JSON file. The consolidated database is hosted publicly and can be accessed via a stable URL.

```bash
# Using curl
curl https://models.hawki.info/models.json > models.json

# Using wget
wget https://models.hawki.info/models.json
```

The `models.json` file contains a single JSON object with two main keys:

* `models`: An array of all available AI models.
* `providers`: An array of all providers offering these models.

Each model entry is enriched with valuable metadata, including:

* A unique `id` and human-readable `name`.
* Supported input and output modalities (`text`, `image`, `audio`, etc.).
* A list of `providers` offering the model, complete with pricing information per currency, context length, and other provider-specific details.
* Technical details like `contextLength` and knowledge cutoff date.
* Capabilities such as `toolCalling`, `reasoning`, and `openWeights` status.

For a complete reference on the data structure, please see our [OpenAPI Schema](https://models.hawki.info).

## ✨ Features

* **Comprehensive & Centralized**: A single source of truth for AI models from a wide array of providers.
* **Always Up-to-Date**: The database is automatically refreshed twice daily, capturing the latest model releases, pricing changes, and deprecated versions.
* **Rich, Structured Data**: Provides deep insights into each model, including pricing per 1M tokens, context windows, supported parameters, modalities, tool-calling abilities, and more.
* **Static & Reliable**: Hosted as a simple JSON file for maximum accessibility, reliability, and ease of integration. No complex API authentication is required.
* **Open and Accessible**: The data is free to use and licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

## 🛠️ How It Works & For Contributors

While this repository provides a static file, the data is the product of an automated workflow that runs on GitHub Actions. This pipeline is responsible for:

1. **Fetching Data**: Gathering raw model information from various online sources.
2. **Processing & Enriching**: Enhancing the data through a series of pluggable steps, including generating summaries with AI, translating descriptions, and converting pricing into multiple currencies.
3. **Consolidating**: Structuring all the information into the clean, final `models.json` format.

The entire generation logic resides in the `.github/.generate` directory.
